Hello there
===========

This is just a toy project for learning how to interface C++ from python using 
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

This project answers a very simple question that always interested me: How does using numpy compare against 
state-of-the-art C++-libraries, such as [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)?
